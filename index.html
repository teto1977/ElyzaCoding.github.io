    <h2>What Is Roblox?</h2>
    <p>Roblox is an online gameing platform. That means anyone using Roblox create their own game for others to play.<br>
I <strong>LOVE</strong> this game.<br>
<strong>You can play with your <em>friends</em> from school and explore worlds together.</strong><br>
Players can play games while seeing other players and socially interacting with them in chat windows.
